# SmartEats Deployment Guide

## Quick Fixes for API Reliability Issues

Your app now includes several optimizations to handle free tier limitations:

### ‚úÖ What Was Fixed:

1. **Retry Logic**: Added exponential backoff retry for failed API calls
2. **Better Error Handling**: Graceful degradation when APIs fail
3. **Optimized Database**: Reduced connection pool size for MongoDB Atlas free tier
4. **CORS Improvements**: Better handling of cross-origin requests
5. **Timeout Handling**: Increased timeouts for Vercel cold starts

### üîß Environment Variables Setup:

#### Backend (.env)
```bash
# MongoDB Atlas
MONGO_URI=mongodb+srv://username:password@cluster.mongodb.net/smarteats?retryWrites=true&w=majority

# JWT
JWT_SECRET=your-super-secret-jwt-key-here
JWT_EXPIRE=30d
JWT_COOKIE_EXPIRE=30

# Frontend URL (for CORS)
FRONTEND_URL=https://your-frontend-domain.vercel.app

# Cloudinary
CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME=your-cloudinary-name
CLOUDINARY_API_KEY=your-api-key
CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET=your-api-secret

# OpenAI (if using AI features)
OPENAI_API_KEY=your-openai-key

# Environment
NODE_ENV=production
```

#### Frontend (.env)
```bash
REACT_APP_API_URL=https://your-backend-domain.vercel.app/api
```

### üì° Vercel Deployment Settings:

#### Backend vercel.json:
- ‚úÖ Already optimized for serverless functions
- ‚úÖ Proper routing configuration

#### Frontend vercel.json:
```json
{
  "rewrites": [
    {
      "source": "/(.*)",
      "destination": "/index.html"
    }
  ]
}
```

### üöÄ Quick Test:

1. Deploy both frontend and backend to Vercel
2. Update environment variables in Vercel dashboard
3. Test login with: demo@smarteats.com / demo123
4. The retry logic will handle any initial slowness

### üí° Free Tier Tips:

1. **MongoDB Atlas**: 
   - Use M0 cluster (free)
   - Keep connections under 100
   - Database will sleep after inactivity

2. **Vercel**: 
   - Functions have 10-second timeout on free tier
   - Cold starts can take 2-3 seconds
   - The retry logic handles this automatically

3. **Cloudinary**:
   - 25 credits/month on free tier
   - Optimize image sizes before upload

### üîç Testing Checklist:

- [ ] Login works (may take 2-3 attempts initially due to cold start)
- [ ] Data loads after authentication
- [ ] Image analysis works (may be slow on first request)
- [ ] Meal saving works
- [ ] Weight tracking works
- [ ] Progress data persists across sessions

### üéØ Why This is Better Than a Video Demo:

1. **Real User Experience**: Shows you can handle production challenges
2. **Technical Skills**: Demonstrates knowledge of retry patterns, error handling
3. **Problem Solving**: Shows you can optimize for real-world constraints
4. **Persistence**: Data actually saves and works across devices

The app should now work reliably even with free tier limitations. The retry logic and optimizations will handle the initial slowness that's common with serverless cold starts.
